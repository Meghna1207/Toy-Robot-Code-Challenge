Welcome to the Toy Robot Simulator

## Project Overview
The Toy Robot Simulator allows users to place a toy robot on a 5x5 grid and command it to move around. You can instruct the robot to move in different directions, turn left or right, and report its current position. This simulator not only demonstrates the principles of movement and direction but also showcases the power of user input in programming.

## Features

- Grid Movement: Move the robot in a 5x5 grid environment.
- Directional Control: Turn the robot to face North, East, South, or West.
- Command Input: Easily input commands through a user-friendly interface.
- Position Reporting: Get the current position and direction of the robot.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For structuring the simulator interface.
- CSS3: For styling the user interface and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For implementing the core functionality and logic of the simulator.
